# BreastCancerBorM
Focused on designing classifier for breast cancer tumor if it is benign or Malignant using MCI Machine leaning dataset, established by university of Wisconsin. After applying expletory data analysis on the datasets, two methods â€“ k nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVMs) - were applied to achieve the classification goals. Further investigation were done on the two methods to improve the classifier. The main concern was to improve the performance as much as possible and to reduce error type II (FN) which classify the patients as been healthy (Benign) while cancer classification is positive. We achieved 97% accuracy using SVMs and 96% accuracy using KNN.
